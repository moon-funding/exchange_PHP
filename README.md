# Moon Funding

## Summary

Moon Funding is a one-stop solution to creating a business from scratch!

**Share an idea.** We’ll evolve it / fill in the gaps. Fund it. Build it. 

You’ll receive frequent dividends if your project achieves profitability.                                                         You can buy/sell your positions on our marketplace in real time. If you want to sell your idea, and walk away at any time – you’re welcome to do that. Once your business is fully established, you can graduate it from our system entirely, and take it off into the world.

**We’re a full service solution!** Writing down your idea, and your rules, is all that’s required of our entrepreneurs. And we even make that part easy!

**To re-iterate in bullet point form, Moon Funding is:**
* A platform for users to post business projects, and for our crowd to brainstorm, and collaborate with the entrepreneur (for a reward!), to develop the idea, it’s documentation, and settings / terms. Aiming to provide complete transparency for all parties.
* An equity crowdfunding platform, using cryptocurrencies to finance user projects.
* An online marketplace for users to buy/sell their (hopefully) dividend paying positions in user projects, in real-time.
* A communications platform, for project managers to share near real-time accounts, and updates, aiming to provide unprecedented levels of operational transparency to their backers. And for the crowd to continually make suggestions, and feedback.
* A crowd control platform, where backers have established procedures to vote on any desired changes / evolutions to the businesses (Voting System).

**In conclusion...**
A fair, and transparent platform for people to list, back, manage and trade startups. Until such time they choose to graduate the startup (now an established business) away from our platform, and into the world.
And we even have a little device, that does it’s best, to protect backers from any failed projects as well (Safety Net).
