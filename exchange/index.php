                    Highest-risk as well as highest-reward investment. 
                    With this type of investment you are a business co-owner, 
                    therefore you can expect to earn between 8-20% annually. 
                    However, as a business owner you don’t only participate in 
                    the gains but also in losses, therefore there is a risk that 
                    you could even lose principal.

                <h3>Fixed-interest loans</h3>
                <p>
                    By investing into fixed-interest loans you become the bank by providing 
                    funding for business operations. Your investment is always collaterallized 
                    by company’s assets, which in case of default will protect your investment. 
                    You can expect to earn a guaranteed 1.5-2.5% interest annually.
